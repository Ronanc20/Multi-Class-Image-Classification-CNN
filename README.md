# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-CNN

> Image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset with tensorflow/keras.

---

## Project Aim

The aim for this project was to build a convolutional neural network capable of classifying images from the CIFAR10 dataset 
with a high degree of accuracy. 

## Dataset

CIFAR-10 consists of random images from 10 different classes as shown in the image below. This dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The data can be read directly from the keras.datasets library and is relatively clean with no missing values and an even class distribution across training and test sets. As a result, this project was more focused on the model architecture side of things with relatively simple data preprocessing compared to other datasets.
